## how to use serangooner

you need java 25 or later. check yours with `java -version`.

### run the released jar

1. download `serangooner.jar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/limenxi07/ip/releases/latest)
2. put it in a folder of its own
3. open a command window in that folder and run:

```bash
java -jar "serangooner.jar"
```

that opens serangooner's chat window. type a command in the box at the
bottom and press enter, or click send.

serangooner keeps your tasks in `data/serangooner.txt` beside the jar, and
makes that folder itself on the first save. run it from the same folder
each time and your list will still be waiting.

### build the jar yourself

from the project root:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

that writes `build/libs/serangooner.jar`, dependencies and all. to start
serangooner without packaging it, run:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

### talk to serangooner in a terminal

serangooner answers on the command line as well as in a window, which is
handy when you want to pipe a batch of commands in. name the command line
version yourself and you get it instead of the window:

```bash
java -cp "serangooner.jar" serangooner.Serangooner
```

it understands exactly the same commands and shares the same
`data/serangooner.txt`, so you can switch between the two whenever you like.

enjoy talking to serangooner!

## why serangooner?
i'm not even a serangoon resident. i just think serangoon is cool, and
that people living in serangoon should be called serangooners.
